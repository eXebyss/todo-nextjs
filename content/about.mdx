# "TODO app" 📝

This is a personal example project of TODO app created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Usage ⚠️

It is pretty simple:

1. Internet connection is required. <b>Offline mode is not supported.</b>
1. Create a new collection or enter ID of already existing.
1. Be aware. Nothing is stored locally forever! Collection is saved in DB and it is safe. Be sure to copy-paste collection ID somewhere, so you can easily access it anytime.
1. If you forgot to copy-paste collection and application is reset, than the only one way to get your collection ID is to check your browser history. If history is cleared, than access to your collection is lost forever.
1. When collection is created, create a new todo list by simply giving it a name.
1. Input a text and wait for 2 seconds. Every new input is submitted after 2 sec of idle.
1. When new todo list created, you are good to go with adding new TODOs.

## Data 🗃️

<b>Nothing is tracked!</b> No data about you is collected! 🕵️

## Database 🗄️

Current application is using [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database.

In order to run and use the application locally and successfully, you need:

1. Register a new user in [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) or use already existing one.
1. Create a new database. See more info: [manual](https://www.mongodb.com/basics/create-database).
1. Setup connection setting for your created mongoDB database.
1. Create or configure `.env` file under root directory.
1. Provide connection value from mongoDB to `MONGODB_URI`.
